# Tool Streaming Support (AI SDK v5)

## Overview
Claude Code now emits full tool streaming events when used through the AI SDK v5 provider. This aligns the provider with the AI SDK's `LanguageModelV2StreamPart` contract, enabling downstream UIs to surface tool calls, inputs, and results in real time.

## Requirements
- **Streaming input enabled**: set `streamingInput: 'always'` or rely on `'auto'` by supplying `canUseTool`.
- **Provider-executed tools**: Claude Code's built-in tools run inside the CLI; for every `tool-call` and `tool-result` event the provider sets `providerExecuted: true` so the AI SDK will not attempt to re-run the tool client-side.
- **Claude Code CLI**: authenticate with `claude login` and ensure the CLI is on your PATH before running streaming examples or tests. Allow the built-in tools explicitly (for example `allowedTools: ['Bash', 'Read']`) or set a permissive permission mode such as `bypassPermissions`.

## Stream Parts Emitted
| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `tool-input-start` | Sent once per tool use with Claude's tool name and a stable ID. |
| `tool-input-delta` | JSON-serialized argument chunks. The provider emits deltas only for incremental prefix updates (new content appended to previous input). Non-prefix updates (corrections, replacements, or duplicate transmissions) do not emit `tool-input-delta`; the final complete input is always captured in the `tool-call` event. |
| `tool-input-end` | Marks completion of the request payload going to the tool. |
| `tool-call` | Includes `toolCallId`, `toolName`, serialized `input`, and `providerExecuted: true`. Raw, non-serialized input is preserved in `providerMetadata['claude-code'].rawInput`. |
| `tool-error` | Emitted when tool execution fails, includes `toolCallId`, `toolName`, error message, and is distinct from `tool-result` with `isError: true`. |
| `tool-result` | Streams the CLI output (JSON parsed when possible) with `toolName`, `toolCallId`, `isError`, `providerExecuted: true`, and the original output under `providerMetadata['claude-code'].rawResult`. |

Text streaming (`text-start`/`text-delta`/`text-end`), response metadata, and finish parts continue to behave as before.

## Usage Example
Run the new example to observe the events:
```bash
npm run build
npx tsx examples/tool-streaming.ts
```
The script approves tools via `canUseTool` and logs each event in order, demonstrating directory listing and file-read operations executed by the CLI.

## Testing & Validation
- Vitest suite includes coverage that asserts tool stream parts surface for provider-executed tools (`src/claude-code-language-model.test.ts`).
- Integration and example scripts rely on the compiled `dist` build; run `npm run build && npm run test` before publishing.
- If stream parts stop appearing, re-run with `DEBUG=1` or enable a custom logger (`settings.logger`) to capture warnings from the underlying SDK.

## Known Limitations
- Claude Code does not emit incremental tool argument chunks today; the provider emits a single `tool-input-delta` payload per tool call unless the SDK starts sending partial updates.
- Delta skipping: If Claude sends non-prefix input updates (e.g., corrections or replacements rather than appends), the provider will skip delta emission and include the final input in the `tool-call` event only.
- Remote image URLs remain unsupported; convert images to base64 data URLs and set `streamingInput` accordingly.

## Performance Considerations
- Delta calculation: Performed only for tool inputs â‰¤ 10KB and for prefix-only updates. Larger or non-prefix updates skip deltas and are captured in the final `tool-call` payload.
- Size limits: Tool inputs exceeding 1MB throw an error. Inputs above 100KB log a warning due to potential performance impact.
- Memory management: Tool state is retained until stream completion to avoid duplicate `tool-call` emissions when multiple result or error chunks arrive.

Note: This provider extends `tool-error` events to include `providerExecuted: true` and `providerMetadata['claude-code']` for parity with tool-call/result. Downstream consumers can safely ignore these fields if not used.
